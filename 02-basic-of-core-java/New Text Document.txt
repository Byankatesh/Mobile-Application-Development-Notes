Basics of Core Java – Object-Oriented Programming Principles
1️⃣ What is Core Java? (WHY First)
🔹 Simple Definition

Core Java is the fundamental part of Java programming that provides the basic concepts required to build applications using object-oriented principles.

📌 Core Java includes:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Control Structures

Classes & Objects

Inheritance

Exception Handling (basic)

🔹 WHY Core Java for Android Development?

Core Java is important because:

📱 Android apps are Java / Kotlin based

🧱 Android framework is fully object-oriented

⚙️ Activities, Fragments, Views → all are classes

🔄 Lifecycle methods use inheritance & polymorphism

🧠 Strong Java basics = easy Android learning

👉 That’s why Core Java is the foundation of Android development

🔹 One-Line Interview Definition

Core Java provides the basic building blocks of Java programming using object-oriented concepts to develop robust applications.

2️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
🔹 What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming approach where software is designed using objects that represent real-world entities.

📌 OOP helps in:

Code reusability

Security

Easy maintenance

Scalability

3️⃣ Basic OOP Building Blocks
🔹 Object

An object is a real-world entity that has:

State (variables)

Behavior (methods)

📌 Example:

Student

Mobile

Button (Android)

🔹 Class

A class is a blueprint from which objects are created.

class Student {
    int rollNo;
    String name;

    void study() {
        System.out.println("Student is studying");
    }
}


📌 Android Example:

Activity

Fragment

ViewModel

4️⃣ Four Pillars of OOP (MOST IMPORTANT)
🔐 4.1 Encapsulation
🔹 Meaning

Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together and protecting data using access modifiers.

class User {
    private String name;

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}


📌 Android Use:

Data security

ViewModel & Repository pattern

🎯 Benefit:
Improves security and data control

🧬 4.2 Inheritance
🔹 Meaning

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another class.

class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
}


📌 Android Example:

MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity


🎯 Benefit:
Code reusability

🔁 4.3 Polymorphism
🔹 Meaning

Polymorphism means one method, different behavior.

class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing circle");
    }
}


📌 Android Use:

Method overriding

Event handling

🎯 Benefit:
Flexible and dynamic code

🎭 4.4 Abstraction
🔹 Meaning

Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.

interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class UPI implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("UPI Payment");
    }
}


📌 Android Use:

Interfaces

Architecture patterns (MVVM)

🎯 Benefit:
Simplifies complex systems

5️⃣ Relationship Between Core Java & Android
Core Java Concept	Android Usage
Class	Activity, Fragment
Object	Views, Intent
Inheritance	AppCompatActivity
Polymorphism	Method overriding
Abstraction	Interfaces, APIs
6️⃣ Advantages of OOP in Android

✔ Code reusability

✔ Better security

✔ Easy maintenance

✔ Scalable architecture

✔ Clean & readable code

7️⃣ Common Interview Traps 🚨
🔴 Is Java fully object-oriented?

❌ No (because of primitive data types)

🔴 Can Android be developed without OOP?

❌ No (Android framework is OOP-based)

🔴 Which OOP concept is most used in Android?

✔ Inheritance & Encapsulation

8️⃣ Checkpoint Questions (During Lecture)

Difference between class and object

Name four pillars of OOP

🧪 Post-Lecture Questions (Assessment)

Explain Object-Oriented Programming

Describe four OOP principles

Difference between abstraction and encapsulation

🎯 Mini Practice Task
👉 Task:

Create a class Employee:

Private variables: id, name

Public getters & setters

Create child class Manager

Override one method

Mention which OOP principles are used.
